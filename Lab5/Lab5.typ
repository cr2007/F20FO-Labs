This code is not considered a secure method of encryption.
It's a very simple transformation that can be easily reversed and doesn't have any sort of key.

It doesn't have any level of confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity that any decent secure encryption algorithm should provide.

You need to start by counting the frequency of the letters and enter them into this table.

#table(
  columns: (1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr, 1fr),
  align: center,
  [*a*], [*b*], [*c*], [*d*], [*e*], [*f*], [*g*], [*h*], [*i*], [*j*], [*k*], [*l*], [*m*],

  [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [],
)

Then compare these values against the second table (which is the expected frequency of letters within English), the most frequent letters in each should be a straight swap - the more text you have to look at the more accurate these straight swaps become.
The remaining swaps are educated guesses.

#question(level: 3, "What are the security advantages of the Vigenère Cipher over a simple substitution cipher?")

Vigenère Cipher has a major security advantage over a simple substitution cipher.
Due to its polyalphabetic nature, i.e. using multiple substitution alphabets, it makes frequency analysis a lot more challenging.
Since a Vigenère Cipher requires a keyword to encrypt and decrypt the message, if a keyword is long enough and chosen in random, it can significantly increase the complexity of breaking the cipher command to a simple substitution cipher.

And since there are 26 possible ways to shift the position of the keyword, it makes a lot more secure than a substitution cipher, which has only one fixed substitution alphabet.

Upon decryption using my private key, I successfully accessed the contents of the encrypted file, originally encrypted with my colleague's private key, and transmitted securely.
This achievement underscores the utilization of secure communication protocols, ensuring the safe exchange of sensitive information.

One reason people lie is  to  achieve personal power. Achieving personal  power is helpful for someone who pretends to be more confident than he really is. For example, one of my friends threw a party at his house last month. He asked me to come to his party and bring a date. However, I didn't have a girlfriend. One of my other friends, who had a date to go to the party with, asked me about my date. I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I claimed that I had a lot of work to do. I said I could easily find  a date even better than his if I wanted to. I also told him that his date was ugly. I achieved power to help me feel  confident; however, I embarrassed my friend and his date. Although this  lie helped me at the time, since then it has made me look down on myself.
```

To achieve power find a confident friend lie.
